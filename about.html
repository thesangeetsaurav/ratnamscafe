		<h1><b><i>We all have cravings that must be taken care of. Growing up, our founder mani ratnam’s fondest food memory was midnight Shahi Tukdas that was prepared by his grandmother. The delicious crispy bread dessert would always make him drool and gratify his sweet tooth. His penchant for food, especially desserts forced him to open the striking pink doors of Ratnam's.</h1>

<h1>Ratnam's Chefs import the finest ingredients from France to whip up the delectable desserts. The menu was conceptualized to boast of a global cuisine with exotic dishes from across the globe.</h1>
<h1>The boss cancel your leave? Have a laphroaig macaron.</h1>

<h1>Had a bad hair day? A blueberry cheesecake can fix that.</h1>

<h1>Have a really bad craving? You better save room ‘cause have you covered.</h1>

<h1>You are never too far from a sugar high when you are at Ratnam's. We got the treats, so dig in!</i></b></h1>
